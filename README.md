#Gavlar50.Umbraco8SiteWithMemberLogin

This is a small Umbraco 8 site which contains a simple members login function. The site content is populated with the Umbraco 8 starter kit. 

Either create a new empty solution and then include the project, else copy all folders into an existing solution (skip packages where they are already present). I've included the packages and binaries folder so everything that's referenced in the project should be available for compilation.
